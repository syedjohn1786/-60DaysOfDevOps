Linux File System
=======================================
The Linux file system is the structure used to organize and manage files on Linux and Unix-like operating systems.

Root Directory (/): Root is the top-level directory in Linux denoted by /. All other files and directories are organized below root directory.
Root directory have below sub-directories :
bin, lib, etc, tmp, usr, home, var

bin : bin Contains all binary executable files ( ex : .exe files)
lib : contains all library files  (ex : .lib files)
etc : Contains all system configuration files and the files which maintain information about users and groups.
tmp : temporary files are stored. System or users create temporary files which will be removed when the server reboots. 
home : Contains user home directories. Each user typically has their own subdirectory within /home.
usr : Default directory provided by Unix OS to create users home directories and containsmanual pages - also contains executable commands
var : var Contains all system log files and message files.

more => t allows users to view the contents of a text file one screen at a time. 
It's particularly useful for reading large files without overwhelming the terminal screen.

Ex: more hello.txt

more -n hello.txt => You can display line numbers along with the file contents by using the -n option:

more -p 20 hello.txt bye.txt => View Two Files At The 20th Line Using more -p
