How K8S Clusters are maintained in RealTime Production
=========================================================

1. Generally for Learning and practicing Kubernets, people use MiniKube, K3S etc. But these are for only Development environments. Minikube, K3S are not used in Production environments.

2. For any Opensource software, it will be having distributions. Ex : For Linux, there are Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS. Similarly, for Kubernetes there are distributions like EKS (Amazon), Openshift (Redhat), AKS (Azure) etc. 

3. KOPS is also used in Production systems which manages the Kubernetes Lifecycle such as Installation, Upgradation, Deletion etc.
